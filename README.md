ContourVerifier: Abstarct domains generated by rigid displacements on contours
ContourVerifier: A novel system for the robustness evaluation of deep contour classifiers

We define the appropriate abstarct domains with Upper and Lower bounds of the shape perturbed with a translation or rotation.
Given this abstract domain, and a set of test contours, ContourVerifier computes the robustness value of the given pre-trained model using DeepPoly analyser based on [ERAN](https://github.com/eth-sri/eran). 
As an initial step, we have created Abstarct domains generated by rigid displacements on contours2D.
The example presented in ![figure](https://github.com/ImenSmatiENSI/ContourVerifier/translation&rotationattacks.png).

In this work, we assume that contours are represented by their x and y Cartesian coordinates.
We carry out our experiments based on two contours datasets, the first is MPEG7 existing contour dataset and the second is a contour dataset generated from
MNIST numbers using a mathematical morphology based on [2D-contours dataset](https://github.com/OueslatiRania/2D-contours-dataset).
We suggest setting the number of points to 120 points for the investigated datasets.
