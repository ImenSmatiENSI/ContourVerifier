ContourVerifier: Abstarct domains generated by rigid displacements on contours
ContourVerifier: A novel system for the robustness evaluation of deep contour classifiers

We define the appropriate abstarct domains with Upper and Lower bounds of the shape perturbed with a translation or rotation.
Given this abstract domain, and a set of test contours, ContourVerifier computes the robustness value of the given pre-trained model using DeepPoly analyser based on [ERAN](https://github.com/ImenSmatiENSI/eth-sri) . 
As an initial step, we have created Abstarct domains generated by rigid displacements on contours2D.
